#5.2. Boolean Operations â€” and, or, not

#These are the Boolean operations, ordered by ascending priority:
#Operation 	Result 	Notes
#x or y 	if x is false, then y, else x 	(1)
#x and y 	if x is false, then x, else y 	(2)
#not x 	if x is false, then True, else False 	(3)

#Notes:

# This is a short-circuit operator, so it only evaluates the second argument if the first one is False.
# This is a short-circuit operator, so it only evaluates the second argument if the first one is True.
# not has a lower priority than non-Boolean operators, so not a == b is interpreted as not (a == b), and a == not b is a syntax error.


#DO NOT USE THE KEYWORD "in".

# A shorter solution
