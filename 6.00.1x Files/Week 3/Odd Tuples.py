secondary way to solve:
    
    def oddTuples(aTup):

    # a placeholder to gather our response

    index = 0

    # Idea: Iterate over the elements in aTup, counting by 2
    #  (every other element) and adding that element to 
    #  the result
    while index < len(aTup):
        rTup += (aTup[index],)
        index += 2

    return rTup
